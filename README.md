# Bidirectional LSTM and LSTM for Next Word Generation

## Introduction

Next word generation is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that involves predicting the most likely next word in a sequence given some input text. It is a fundamental problem in NLP and has various applications, including autocomplete features in search engines, predictive text in smartphones, and text generation in chatbots.

## Importance and Use Cases

- **Autocomplete and Predictive Text:** Next word generation is commonly used in search engines, word processors, and messaging applications to suggest the next word as users type, improving typing speed and accuracy.

- **Language Modeling:** Next word prediction is crucial in language modeling tasks, where the goal is to predict the probability distribution of words in a sentence or document. Language models are essential for tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text summarization.

- **Chatbots and Conversational AI:** Next word generation enables chatbots and virtual assistants to generate human-like responses in conversations. By predicting the next word, chatbots can generate contextually relevant and coherent responses, enhancing the user experience.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building Bidirectional LSTM and LSTM models for next word generation using Python and TensorFlow. The provided code preprocesses textual data from Medium article titles, tokenizes the text, and trains the models to predict the next word given a sequence of words. The trained models are evaluated based on accuracy and loss metrics, and they are used to generate next words for given input sequences.

## Code Description

1. **Data Preparation:** The code starts by importing necessary libraries and loading textual data from a CSV file containing Medium article titles. Data cleaning steps involve replacing special characters and tokenizing the text using the Tokenizer class from TensorFlow.

2. **Tokenization and Padding:** The text data is tokenized, and input sequences are generated by sliding a window over the tokenized text. The sequences are padded to ensure uniform length for model input.

3. **Model Building:** Sequential models are created using TensorFlow's Keras API, consisting of an Embedding layer, Bidirectional LSTM layer (or LSTM layer), and a Dense output layer with softmax activation. The models are compiled with appropriate loss and optimizer functions.

4. **Model Training:** The models are trained on the input sequences with their corresponding labels (next words) using the fit() method. Training history is stored to analyze model performance.

5. **Model Evaluation:** The accuracy and loss metrics are plotted over epochs to assess model performance and convergence.

6. **Next Word Generation:** A function is defined to generate next words given input sequences. The trained models are used to predict the next word based on the input text, demonstrating the model's ability to generate contextually relevant predictions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of Bidirectional LSTM and LSTM models for next word generation, showcasing their importance and applications in NLP tasks. By training these models on textual data and evaluating their performance, we can develop powerful language models capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text.
